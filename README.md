# Eclipse-checkstyle Plugin

#### Checks implemented

 1. "Number of comments" check   
   Single line and block comments are counted for each file.
      
 2.  " Halstead length" check  
       Counts both operand and operators. I referenced https://www.javatpoint.com/operators-in-java for all the java operators.  
       Also, for the operands, I assumed it was all int, float,double ,long, and literals.
